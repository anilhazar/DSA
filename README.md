# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## C Projects

### BinarySearchTreeOperations

This code performs various operations on a binary search tree (BST). It includes creating a BST, inserting nodes, deleting nodes, printing the tree, destroying the tree, finding parent and grandparent nodes, checking if nodes are siblings, and finding the level of a node.

### LinkedListOperations

This code performs various operations on a linked list. It includes creating a linked list, inserting nodes, deleting nodes, printing the list, and destroying the list.

### StackOperations

This code performs various operations on a stack. It includes creating a stack, inserting nodes, deleting nodes, printing the stack, and destroying the stack.

## Java Projects

### LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters

This Java project finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string. It utilizes a HashSet to efficiently track characters and determine the length of the longest substring without repetition.
